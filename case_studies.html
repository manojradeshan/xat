          <p>The brief for this London garden was for it to look good throughout the year both from the ground floo
            and the first floor.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The line of the canal determines the geometry of the whole garden and Box hedges in raised brick beds
            follow its line rather than the irregular shape of the walls.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The walls are lined with trellis and large topiary in Versailles cases are arranged symmetrically. Lead
            pots with Arum Lilies line the canal and George Carter designed the frost work lead obelisk water feature

          <p>The house and gardens look over a Grade I 18th century park and there is a fine woodland garden behind the
            house. In
            1999 I was asked to design a summer garden to create colour and interest</p>

          <p>This walled garden was first laid out in 1860. In 1998 I was asked to remodel the whole garden. It was
            deeply
            conventional with its mixture of veg, fruit, flowers and shrubs.</p>
          <br>
          <p>But it lacked structure within it, so garden rooms were installed with permanent structures, each providing
            a different
            service and personality.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The Long Borders dissect the garden into four sections, each section subdivided by ironwork arches
            providing working and
            decorative gardens.</p>

          <p>My brief here was to create a classical garden and most importantly one that people could relate to.</p>
          <br>
          <p>At the front is a York stone terrace on which stand eight classical round brick columns topped with
            ironwork.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The garden is divided into a formal area with its long borders at the base of brick walls. The planting was
            a mixture of
            reds, pinks, purples, blues and creams. There is a Box edged stone seat and a central feature with Arum
            Lilies, which
            are also echoed in the wrought iron gate, leading to an informal woodland area.</p>
          <br>
          <p>There are several pictures of other Chelsea gardens I have designed.</p>

          <p>This cloister garden was a central courtyard of a large Tudor house. Because of civil wars and a serious
            fire it was
            rebuilt in 1653 and an account of a knot garden in 1623 led me to design this garden in 1997. It was
            important not to
            distract from the wealth of pictures and sculptures in the house but at the same time it had to look good
            from the upper
            cloisters.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The design of each quadrant was taken from the patterns in the facing sides of the central well-head, which
            is 9th
            century Venetian. Only three varieties of plants were used, namely Box, Cotton Lavender and standard Bay
            trees.</p>

          <h3>RHS Garden Hyde Hall</h3>
          <h4>Essex</h4>

          <p>The Hyde Hall garden in Essex became the responsibility of the RHS in 1993 and has undergone huge
            restoration and new
            gardens.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The Witan Global Growth garden was opened in 2016. I designed it with education and science in my mind
            following an idea
            of making a garden that grew edible plants from all over the world. We concentrated on Europe, North
            America, South
            America and Asia as being the most interesting and prolific of the continents.</p>
          <br>
          <p>It is a large round area with a 50m diameter. In the centre is the Hartley Botanica greenhouse and around
            it are raised
            beds of different heights and shapes divided into 4, denoting the specific region. Behind the Osmanthus
            hedge, are 4
            large grassy mounds with beds of the shrubs and trees of the relative continent. Everything in this garden
            is edible, be
            it flowers, leaves, berries, fruits or roots and tubers .</p>
          <br>
          <p>It is designed for everyone to enjoy but also to learn about so many different plants that we grow as
            ornamentals but
            which are eaten in other parts of the world.
            So this attracts many school groups .</p>
